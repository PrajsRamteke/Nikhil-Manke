            The capacity of a battery to store charge is often expressed in Ampere hour (1 Ah = 3600
            coulombs). If a battery can provide one ampere (1 A) of current (flow) for one hour it has a
            real-world capacity of 1 Ah. If it can provide 10 A for 10 hours, its capacity is 100 Ah.
            Battery manufacturers use a standard method to determine how to rate their batteries.
            <br>
            The battery is discharged at a constant rate of current over a fixed period of time, such as 10
            hours or 20 hours, down to a set terminal voltage per cell. So a 100 ampere-hour battery is
            rated as C20 to provide 5 A for 20 hours at room temperature. The efficiency of a battery is
            different at different discharge rates.

            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
            collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
            control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can
            modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting
            that
            just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does
            limit
            overflow.
